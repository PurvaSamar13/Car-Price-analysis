# Car-Price-analysis-System

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Car Price Analysis System is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and predict car prices based on various features and historical data. This system leverages machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to provide valuable insights into car pricing trends and factors influencing them.

OVERVIEW

Data is collected from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/car-price-prediction-dataset

Features:<br />
Data Collection: Import car price data from various sources.<br /> 
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.<br /> 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore data patterns.<br /> 
Price Prediction: Predict car prices using machine learning models.<br /> 
Feature Importance: Identify key factors influencing car prices.<br /> 
User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for data input and results visualization.<br /> 

<p>What we have performed in this project is:<br /> 

We do basic descriptive analytics with pandas which is about finding the shape of data means how many rows and columns of data.<br /> 
Mean, median, mode, Standard deviation, percentile, of numeric columns of data and classes, and unique values of categorical columns.<br /> 
Finding the missing values, outlier detection, find the correlation between the variables.<br /> 
Perform linear regression and pre processing.</p>
