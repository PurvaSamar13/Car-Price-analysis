# Car-Price-analysis-System

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Car Price Analysis System is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and predict car prices based on various features and historical data. This system leverages machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to provide valuable insights into car pricing trends and factors influencing them.

OVERVIEW

Data is collected from kaggle:


Features:<br />
Data Collection: Import car price data from various sources.<br /> 
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.<br /> 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore data patterns.<br /> 
Price Prediction: Predict car prices using machine learning models.<br /> 
Feature Importance: Identify key factors influencing car prices.<br /> 
User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for data input and results visualization.<br />
